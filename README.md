Take notes on Google Glass for classes, conversations, and TODOs - syncs to Github

## Vision

Imagine taking detailed notes in class while staying engaged with the material discussed.

### What students struggle with right now

There are a few main problems this project tackles head-on:

1. **Capturing both content and understanding.**  
    Typically, we can either take really detailed notes or can focus on the lecture and understand the concepts. However, taking detailed notes mean we miss the understanding. Focusing soley on the lectures means that we lose the understanding we could gain by staying engaged with the lecturer.
    
2. **Taking notes where information is received, our eyes.**  
    Usually, we have a notebook or laptop in front of us when we're taking notes. Both involve taking your eyes off of the whiteboard, presentation, or speaker in front of us. Taking notes on a heads-up display (HUD) like Glass allows our eyes to stay engaged with the content while still taking detailed notes. As visual creatures, keeping both the input (lecture) and output (notes) of the classroom setting near the eyes just makes intuitive sense.
    
3. **Syncing our notes online.** . 
   The worst feeling students can possibly have is losing a notebook or accidently losing a Word document with incredibly valuable information. Google Docs allows us to take notes quickly and ensures us that our notes are saved forever. However, presenting a Google Docs GUI on Glass is nearly impossible both in terms of user interface and browser technology. It's just hard to use and hard to get working.
    
### What this project creates

1. **A simple UI for taking notes anytime on the go while staying engaged with the world.** . 
    Simply say an "Ok Glass" command and create up a new note. You'll be taking notes in Markdown (`.md`) which allows for semi-rich text editing through an easy-to-learn and well-designed syntax.

2. **Incremental and frequent notes saved to a Git repository.** . 
    Git is great! We leverage Git for committing incremental changes to notes and syncing them to a Git repository of your choosing!
